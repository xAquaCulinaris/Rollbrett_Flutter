# rollbrett_rottweil

This a Flutter App for the Skatepark in Rottweil that im currently working on
It uses Firebase to handle User Authentication and Upload Videos/Images + Data

What the App does:
 - Registration & Login of users
 - Scanning for BLE Beacons, if it finds some in the Skatepark you can read some information about some obstacle in the park
 - If you are near a Beacon you can Post Skatevideos that you have recorded in the Skatepark or you can watch Videos of other people
 - You can Play a Game of Skate against your friends with all the Obstacles that are in the Skatepark Rottweil
